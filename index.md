# Getting Started

Exegol Finance is a decentralized reserve currency protocol ecosystem based on **maximizing yield** using **market neutral strategies**, using one line of credit across multiple chains.

Each eUSD token is backed by a basket of assets in the Exegol Finance treasury, giving it an intrinsic value pegged to the US Dollar redeemable at any time.

Exegol strives to introduces a new branch of crypto as a whole through its unique ecosystem of maximizing market neutral yield in a risk averse, scalable manner.

## How to use eUSD

Generating returns with eUSD is as simple as buying and holding eUSD in your wallet. This means that you can safely store eUSD in cold storage and still have access to high yields across multiple chains.

eUSD can be bought on the [Exegol website](https://www.exegol.fi) ([guide](./howto.md)), or from any DEX offering eUSD pairs.
