# Risks

At Exegol, our highest prority is the safety of our investors funds. While generating returns is a core goal, we also recognise the need for transparency and risk management. We uphold the principle of maximizing upside while minimizing downside while crafting our unique strategies. In order to have a robust risk management system, we have created a tailor-made multi-pronged risk management strategy which will be shared with our users via financial reports and community announcements. We believe this would allow us to offer the highest yielding strategies to our investors while remaining risk averse.

Some of the risk-management steps that we take are

- a thorough review of the protocol contracts
- reviewing protocol economics, identifying source of yield to evaluate sustainability
- actively reporting on and monitoring the portfolio
- partnering with on chain insurance to ensure further investor safety

The Exegol team **will not under any condition** make directional bets on volatile assets, or otherwise gamble with userâ€™s deposits. This violates our core principles of providing a low risk asset with relatively high yield. Any exposure to volatile assets will be hedged using lending protocols or perpetuals, depending on the requirements.

To protect against depeg risk, the Exegol team will stick to established stablecoins with proven backing such as BUSD, USDC, and DAI. If a strategy requires exposure to an untrusted stablecoin or stablecoins with partial or no backing, Exegol will try to hedge the depeg risk using lending protocols or by engaging with on-chain insurance protocols.

All investor funds are managed by and deployed using multisig wallets. All team members follow strict opsec practices to prevent loss of funds.

At Exegol, we try to reduce risk for users as much as possible, however investors who invest in eUSD take on the following risks

- Smart contract risk
- Loss due to unforseeing market conditions
- Loss due to treasury losses
