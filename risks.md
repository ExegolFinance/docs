# Risks

At Exegol, our highest prority is the safety of our investors funds. While generating returns is a core goal, we also recognise the need for transparency and risk management. We uphold the principle of maximizing upside while minimizing downside while crafting our unique strategies. In order to have a robust risk management system, we have created a tailor-made multi-pronged risk management strategy which will be shared with our users via financial reports and community announcements. We believe this would allow us to offer the highest yielding strategies to our investors while remaining risk averse.

Some of the risk-management steps that we take are

- a thorough review of the protocol contracts
- reviewing protocol economics, identifying source of yield to evaluate sustainability
- actively reporting on and monitoring the portfolio
- partnering with on chain insurance to ensure further investor safety

At Exegol, we try to reduce risk for users as much as possible, however investors who invest in eUSD take on the following risks

- smart contract risk
- loss due to unforseeing market conditions
